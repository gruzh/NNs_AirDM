## Brief description of this research
This study explores key concepts related to air quality, atmospheric emission modeling,
and the critical parameters involved in pollutant dispersion analysis. Emission, meteorological, and
stack data were collected from official, private, and public sources. We compare the performance of the
CALPUFF dispersion model with a neural network-based approach for predicting SO2 concentration
in the Industrial Bay of Mejillones, Chile.
